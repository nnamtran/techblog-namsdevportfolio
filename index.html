        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">Short story, it was a lovely sunday, as I finished off my half melted ice cream on the golden sand beach on the west coast of Devon. The beach took its name because it was literally made up of golden sand as far as I could see. As I took a stroll down the beach towards the sea I started noticing dead animals crabs, fish and in the distance what looked like a shark. But no, not in England. I continued my stroll until I found myself paddling in the crystal clear water. All my troubles were floating away and I was peaceful and life was good! Then all of a sudden a crab bit my big toe! As I screamed I wondered firstly what I was doing in Devon, I wasn't on holiday and didn't live there! Then my phone rang, I opened my eyes and answered my phone. I had been asleep and all now there was someone screaming in my ear. I couldn't quite make out what was being said</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Middle</h2>
        <p class="middle">Some of the crowd whome had gathered hours before were still hanging around and were following us all the way to the cinema as I picked up the pace so did they, we jumped on a bus and they were soon just a blur in the distance. I could now concentrate on making the date a special as I could so I turned on the old charm and we sat down towards the back of the cinema with our popcorn then hitting the back of my head. I ignored it for a little while until it was annoying me so much I had to turn around, but the cinema wasn't even half full and there was only a couple of old age pensioners and a couple kissing in the corner. Surely it wasn't any of them, so I turned around and started watching the rest of the film. But then I felt hot, steamy breath of the back of my neck, slowly breathing in and out</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I slowly felt myself falling asleep so tuned off the television and shut my eyes. I was soon in a deep sleep and found myself having the same dream as the night before and as I walked down the beach towards the sea I saw all the dead animals spread along the beach and as I paddled in the warm sea I heard the sound of broken glass I didn't wake up but as I swam further out to sea I felt a huge pain all over my body I was being attacked by crabs. They were biting me all over my body. I was awake, the window was smashed, some of the crowd had gathered on my roof and were putting crabs into the room. They were biting me all over my body, there was blood everywhere. But then my phone rang again I answered it, there was someone screaming in my ear. I couldn't quite make out what was being said but it went a bit like this:"Where are you? It's half two you promised, this time you've taken it so far!" Then the phone was slammed down and I was left in a dizzy phase of confusion</p>
